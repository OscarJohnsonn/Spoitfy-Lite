A Light-Weight Spotify Client written in **Python**.

## ‚ùì Explanation
You may have possibly heard and used Spotify once in your life, right?

It can be very resource-intensive, especially with other programs running in the background.

Hence, why `Spotify-Lite` was made.

It uses less memory and loads music and podcasts faster compared to the microsoft store and windows versions of the Spotify client.


## ‚≠ê Clarifications
This isn't any over-the-top "client" of such.\
This is simply a Spotify Web Instance running in a "Custom Browser" to reduce memory usage and *not* feast on your RAM.

You should be able to use Spotify just as you can with any other client. :D
